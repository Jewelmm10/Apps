                <p>VigiBSMMU will launched by the BSMMU in 2023 to provide public access to information in VigiBSMMU, the database of reported potential side effects of medicinal products. Side effects – known technically as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) – are reported by national pharmacovigilance centres of Bangladesh to ensure the safe and effective use of medicinal products.</p>
                
                <p>Due to strict data protection laws and agreements, individual case safety reports cannot be viewed. For those same reasons, VigiBSMMU groups the search results both by active ingredient and by hospitals, districts, so you will not be able to retrieve data for specific brand names nor for individual. For more detailed questions about the data, please contact with authority.</p>

                <h3 class="font-semibold my-3">Special note regarding COVID-19 vaccine data</h3>
                <p>VTo see VigiBSMMU data on COVID-19 vaccines, search for “covid-19 vaccine”. Please note that VigiBSMMU, as a result of the terminology used to structure the information, will group the data for vaccines by disease (for example, “Measles vaccine”, “Mumps vaccine”) will result in the total number of cases reported for all vaccines. It is not possible in VigiBSMMU to separate the numbers for specific vaccines.</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-semibold my-3">Important points to consider</h3>
                <p>VigiBSMMU is intended as a useful starting point for people who wish to understand more about the types of potential side effects that have been reported following the use of medicinal products. However, VigiBSMMU cannot be used to infer any confirmed link between a suspected side effect and any specific medicine. See the VigiBSMMU FAQ for a more detailed explanation.</p>
                <p>The information on this website relates to potential side effects; that is, symptoms and other circumstances that have been observed following the use of a medicinal product, but which may or may not be related to or caused by that product.</p>
                <p>VigiBSMMU cannot be used to determine the likelihood of a side effect occurring. A VigiBSMMU search on a medicinal product will return a basic list of reported potential side effects and the number of times each effect has been reported. However, the database does not include other factors needed to put that number into context, such as how many people have taken the product, how long they have taken it, how long it has been on the market, and the differing reporting practices that influence which observations are included in the reports.</p>
                <p>VigiBSMMU cannot be used to compare the safety profiles of different medicinal products. VigiBSMMU cannot provide sufficient context to make such comparisons possible.</p>
                <p>The information on VigiBSMMU should not be used in isolation to make any decisions regarding a patient's treatment regimen. Patients and their healthcare providers should always consult other sources of information, including the product inserts and other recognised sources of prescribing information. If you think that you may be experiencing a side effect from a medicinal product, please seek advice from a healthcare professional as soon as possible. Never stop or change the dose for any prescription medicines without consulting your physician. For more information about the uses and limitations of VigiBSMMU, please read the VigiBSMMU.</p>
